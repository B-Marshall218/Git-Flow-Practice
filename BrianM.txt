I have no idea if this will work: 
Edit your file. Introduce yourself by name. List three words that describe you. 
Write a few sentences or a paragraph about your favorite hobby, 
your favorite animal, or another personal favorite suitable for sharing on a public site.

Hello world. I'm Brian Marshall. I would describe myself as humble with a sense of humor who 
loves to learn and improve myself in anyway possible. 
My favorite hobby would be snowboarding and having bonfires with friends. My favorite animal 
would be a wolf. I have gone sky diving, climbed a volcanoe, and swam with whale sharks, however 
spiders and snakes creep me TF out.
